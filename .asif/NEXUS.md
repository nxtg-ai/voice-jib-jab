## Initiative Details

### N-01: Voice Loop MVP
**Pillar**: RESPONSIVENESS | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: Mic → WebSocket → OpenAI Realtime → playback. Barge-in working. 500ms latency baseline achieved.

### N-02: Lane Arbitration System
**Pillar**: INTERACTION | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: 2-lane state machine (Lane A reflex, Lane B reasoning). Preemption logic prevents overlap. 100% transition coverage.

### N-03: Audio Buffer Race Fix
**Pillar**: RESPONSIVENESS | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: Confirmation protocol + 50ms safety window. 3-layer guards (duration, safety, VAD).

### N-04: State Machine Resilience
**Pillar**: RESPONSIVENESS | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: LaneArbitrator handles all state transitions. Error recovery + resetResponseInProgress().

### N-05: Persistent Memory (ChromaDB)
**Pillar**: GROUNDING | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P1
**What**: Cross-session conversation context via vector embeddings.

### N-06: Enterprise UI Transformation
**Pillar**: INTERACTION | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P1
**What**: Electric blue design system. Tailwind-first. Performance metrics as hero feature.

### N-07: Lane C Control Plane v1
**Pillar**: GOVERNANCE | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: PolicyGate, AuditTrail, LatencyBudget, AllowedClaimsRegistry, FallbackPlanner. Stubs in place.
**Actual (2026-02-20 NIGHT)**: Production hardening — fixed 3 resource leaks and added 2 reliability improvements:
- **EventBus session listener leak**: `onSession()` now tracks wrapped handlers per session; `offSession()` properly removes them (was no-op before). `ControlEngine.destroy()` calls `offSession()`.
- **AuditTrail writeQueues leak**: Write queue `Map` entries now cleaned up on `session.end` events.
- **PolicyGate short-circuit**: Evaluation now breaks early on `cancel_output` or critical-severity `refuse`/`escalate` — avoids wasted downstream checks.
- **FallbackPlanner TTS timeout**: `getAudio()` wraps TTS call in `Promise.race` with 5s timeout; prevents indefinite hang.
- **FallbackPlanner cache limit**: Audio cache capped at 50 entries with FIFO eviction.
**Actual (2026-02-21)**: Content moderation system — ModeratorCheck upgraded from empty stub to production-ready categorized pattern engine:
- **7 moderation categories**: JAILBREAK (prompt injection), SELF_HARM (escalate to human), VIOLENCE_THREATS, HATE_SPEECH, ILLEGAL_ACTIVITY, EXPLICIT_CONTENT, HARASSMENT.
- **Category-aware matching**: Each category has its own decision type (refuse vs escalate), severity, and reason codes (`MODERATION:<CATEGORY_NAME>`).
- **Self-harm escalation**: SELF_HARM triggers `escalate` (human handoff) instead of `refuse`, with priority ordering (checked before VIOLENCE to correctly handle "i want to kill myself").
- **Zero false-positive design**: Patterns use word boundaries, person-object requirements on violence verbs, negative lookaheads to exclude self-harm from violence. 20+ enterprise text scenarios verified clean.
- **Backward-compatible**: `ModeratorCheck` still accepts `RegExp[]` for legacy use; categories are the new default via `ControlEngineConfig.moderationCategories`.
- **134 new tests**: Category structure validation, per-category positive/negative cases, category-aware reason codes, legacy mode, regex lastIndex safety, enterprise false-positive suite.
**Shipped scope**: PolicyGate (short-circuit on critical decisions), AuditTrail (session cleanup), LatencyBudget, AllowedClaimsRegistry, FallbackPlanner (TTS 5s timeout, 50-entry FIFO cache), ModeratorCheck (7-category production engine with 134 tests). 3 resource leaks fixed. v2 scope moved to N-14.

### N-08: Knowledge Pack Retrieval
**Pillar**: GROUNDING | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P1
**What**: ChromaDB retrieval + Whisper transcription + fact injection into Lane B.
**Shipped scope**: RAGPipeline (138 LOC), RetrievalService (301 LOC), KnowledgePack (64 LOC), VectorStore (199 LOC), DisclaimerLookup (164 LOC). Integrated into Lane B with `retrievalService.retrieveFactsPack()`. 363 LOC tests across 3 test suites. Integration testing with real knowledge packs deferred to production usage.

### N-09: Unit Test Coverage
**Pillar**: OBSERVABILITY | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: Current 14.69% → target 85%. OpenAIRealtimeAdapter needs 70+ tests. WebSocket mocking being resolved.
**Actual (2026-02-18)**: 40/41 server tests passing (1 timeout). 24/41 full-suite failures are test infra issues (missing AudioContext mock, WebSocket fake timer leaks, empty test shells). Coverage provider not installed — need `@vitest/coverage-v8`.
**Actual (2026-02-19)**: 232/232 total tests passing (41 client + 191 server). Coverage provider installed. Client 35.37%, Server 37.54%. All test infra issues resolved (mock setup, fake timer interleaving, TypeScript errors).
**Actual (2026-02-20)**: 558/558 total tests passing (41 client + 517 server). Server coverage 67.7% stmts (was 38.74%). 11 new test suites covering storage (Database 94%, SessionHistory 96%, TranscriptStore 93%), insurance (PolicyGate 96.59%, AllowedClaimsRegistry 89%, AuditTrail 72%, FallbackPlanner 82%), lanes (LaneA 85%, LaneC 100%, ControlEngine 69%), and config (reflexWhitelist 95%). Two TS errors fixed (allowed_claims_registry TS2532, fallback_planner TS2322).
**Actual (2026-02-20 PM)**: 713/713 total tests passing (41 client + 672 server). Server coverage clears 70% CI gate: Stmts 78.84%, Branches 70.00%, Functions 81.29%, Lines 78.99%. +155 new tests across 7 suites: ConfigLoader (31), OpenAITTS (24), SessionManager (35), DisclaimerLookup (42), KnowledgePack (10), RAGPipeline (10), RetrievalIndex (3). Branch coverage boosted from 59.45%→70% via targeted tests on ControlEngine handleEvent switch, AuditTrail timeline loading, FallbackPlanner edge cases, LatencyBudget marker paths, EventBus onPattern, and retrieval modules.
**Actual (2026-02-20 EVE)**: 885/885 total tests passing (41 client + 844 server). Server coverage EXCEEDS 85% target: Stmts 90.87%, Branches 81.19%, Functions 89.68%, Lines 91.20%. +131 new tests across 2 suites: WebSocketServer (62), WebSocketMessages (69). websocket.ts went from 0% to 97% (Stmts 96.98%, Branches 93.63%, Functions 97.22%). The largest untested file is now fully covered.
**Status**: SHIPPED. Server coverage: Stmts 90.87%, Branches 81.19%, Functions 89.68%, Lines 91.20%. 890 total tests (849 server + 41 client). CI gate at 70% passing. Remaining gaps: OpenAIRealtimeAdapter (73.8%), client components — diminishing returns; coverage exceeds target on 3/4 metrics.

### N-10: Production Readiness QA
**Pillar**: OBSERVABILITY | **Status**: SHIPPED | **Priority**: P0
**What**: Security audit, load testing (concurrent sessions), SLA validation, monitoring.
**Shipped scope**: Load test (200 concurrent WS sessions, p95 TTFB 126.7ms vs 1200ms SLA), SLA baseline, security audit (0 production vulns, 36 devDeps-only), secrets review (clean), production runbook (`RUNBOOK.md`), UAT guide (`UAT-Guide.md`). Monitoring/alerting deferred to production deployment (requires Prometheus/Grafana infrastructure).

### N-11: SIP Telephony
**Pillar**: EXTENSIBILITY | **Status**: IDEA | **Priority**: P1
**What**: StubTelephonyAdapter v1 (testing). LiveKitSIPTelephonyAdapter for v2 (real SIP).

### N-12: Ticketing Integration (MCP)
**Pillar**: EXTENSIBILITY | **Status**: IDEA | **Priority**: P1
**What**: LocalTicketingAdapter v1 (PostgreSQL). Zendesk/ServiceNow MCP adapters for enterprise.

### N-13: Multi-Tenant Isolation
**Pillar**: GOVERNANCE | **Status**: IDEA | **Priority**: P1
**What**: Org-scoped knowledge, policy, audit. Admin console. RBAC (admin, agent, viewer).

### N-14: Lane C v2: Semantic Governance
**Pillar**: GOVERNANCE | **Status**: IDEA | **Priority**: P2
**What**: Tier 2 semantic moderation (OpenAI Moderation API) for subtle/context-dependent violations. Embedding similarity for claims matching (vs. word-overlap). OPA integration (PI-002) for declarative policy rules. Successor to N-07 v1 scope.

**Implementation Notes (PI-007 OPA WASM Research — 2026-02-28)**:
- **Latency**: OPA compiled to WebAssembly delivers **sub-10 microsecond** policy evaluation — negligible against sub-400ms SLA.
- **Package**: `@open-policy-agent/opa-wasm` v1.10.0 — TypeScript-typed, in-process (no sidecar, no network hop).
- **Migration path** (3 phases when N-14 activates):
  - **Phase 1** — PolicyGate → Rego: Current decision tree maps directly to Rego semantics. Declare `allow`/`deny`/`cancel_output` rules; replace `PolicyGate.evaluate()` with OPA WASM instance.
  - **Phase 2** — ModeratorCheck → Rego + OpenAI Moderation API: Keep pattern engine as Tier 1 (zero-latency). Add Tier 2 semantic moderation via `openai.moderations.create()` for context-dependent violations. Gate behind Rego rule: invoke Tier 2 only when Tier 1 returns `allow`.
  - **Phase 3** — AllowedClaimsRegistry → Rego + ChromaDB embedding similarity: Replace word-overlap with vector cosine similarity. Feed scores into Rego data document; rule decides allow/deny threshold.
- **Cross-project reuse**: oneDB (P-09) has 40/40 OPA tests across 7 policy primitives. Their deny-by-default Rego patterns are directly reusable for Lane C.
- **Estimated effort**: L (3-5 days — Rego authoring, WASM bundle, Tier 2 API integration, 50+ new tests).

## UAT Findings (5 Bugs)

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | Audio feedback loop — AI responds to ambient noise endlessly | FIXED — 3-layer defense (echo cancellation + cooldown + RMS gate) |
| 2 | HIGH | Stop button unresponsive — requires 3 clicks | FIXED — response.end deferred while audio playing + audio-aware click handler |
| 3 | HIGH | Server keeps streaming after client stop (30s+ lag) | FIXED — audioStopped guard on output handlers + cancel/stop ack protocol |
| 4 | POSITIVE | Voice response latency near-instant (~500ms) | PRESERVED — TTFB tracked & displayed |
| 5 | CRITICAL | Audit trail FK failure on WebSocket connect (race condition) | FIXED — INSERT OR IGNORE placeholder row before audit events |

## CoS Directives

> Completed directives archived to [NEXUS-archive.md](./NEXUS-archive.md).

### DIRECTIVE-NXTG-20260304-01 — Lane C v2 Phase 1: PolicyGate → OPA Rego
**From**: NXTG-AI CoS | **Priority**: P1
**Injected**: 2026-03-04 | **Estimate**: M | **Status**: PENDING

> **Estimate key**: S = hours (same session), M = 1-2 days, L = 3+ days

**Context**: 10/14 initiatives shipped. Team idle 3 days. N-14 research complete (PI-007 OPA WASM). Phase 1 is self-contained and unblocks Phases 2-3.

**Action Items**:
1. [ ] Install `@open-policy-agent/opa-wasm` v1.10.0 — verify it loads in-process, no sidecar
2. [ ] Author Rego policy bundle for PolicyGate: translate existing decision tree (allow/deny/cancel_output/escalate) to declarative Rego rules
3. [ ] Replace `PolicyGate.evaluate()` internals with OPA WASM instance — keep the same TypeScript interface so ControlEngine callers are unaffected
4. [ ] Reuse deny-by-default Rego patterns from oneDB (P-09) — reference `~/projects/oneDB/` for their 7 policy primitives and 40 OPA tests
5. [ ] Write 30+ new tests: Rego rule evaluation, WASM loading, backward compatibility with existing PolicyGate tests, latency assertion (<1ms per evaluation)
6. [ ] Update N-14 status from IDEA → BUILDING. Update changelog.
7. [ ] Run full test suite — 1028 baseline must not decrease. Report final count.

**Constraints**:
- Phase 1 ONLY. Do NOT touch ModeratorCheck (Phase 2) or AllowedClaimsRegistry (Phase 3) yet.
- Keep existing PolicyGate interface unchanged — this is an internal implementation swap, not an API change.
- USE PLAN MODE before coding. Outline the Rego rule structure first.

## Portfolio Intelligence

_Cross-project insights injected by ASIF CoS. Read these for awareness — they inform your priorities._

### PI-001: Podcast-Pipeline TTS Engines May Replace OpenAI TTS (2026-02-17)
Podcast-Pipeline (P-04) has shipped F5-TTS and is bake-off testing OpenVoice v2, CosyVoice, and XTTS-v2 for voice cloning quality. These local-first TTS engines could eventually replace your dependency on the OpenAI Realtime API for speech synthesis — reducing latency, cost, and external dependency. No action now, but be aware of bake-off results when they ship.

### PI-002: OPA Policy Engine for Lane C Governance (2026-02-17)
oneDB (P-09) pioneered OPA deny-by-default policy enforcement. Your Lane C control plane (N-07) currently uses custom stubs for policy gates. When hardening Lane C, consider OPA as a formalized policy engine — it would give you declarative, auditable rules instead of bespoke code.

### PI-003: DesktopAI OllamaClient Pattern (2026-02-17)
DesktopAI (P-01) has the most mature Ollama integration in the portfolio: retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker (3 failures → 30s cooldown), streaming, structured output. If you ever move TTS or LLM inference to local Ollama, reference their client pattern.

### PI-004: Forge Has the Most Mature WebSocket Implementation (2026-02-18)
NXTG-Forge (P-03) Infinity Terminal (N-02) has the portfolio's most battle-tested WebSocket: PTY bridge with session persistence through browser close/reconnects, 5-min keepalive, multi-client support, xterm.js 6.0. Your UAT bugs #2 (stop button unresponsive) and #3 (server streams after stop) are WebSocket event delivery issues. When fixing, reference Forge's event confirmation protocol.

### PI-005: HunyuanVideo-Avatar Could Enable Visual Talking-Head Mode (2026-02-19)
Podcast-Pipeline (P-04) has selected HunyuanVideo-Avatar (Tencent) for audio-driven talking-head video generation. The model takes a speaker photo + audio and produces lip-synced video with emotion control. It runs on ~10GB VRAM (RTX 4090 has 24GB). This could give voice-jib-jab a visual mode — users see an animated talking head during conversations. When Podcast-Pipeline installs and tests it, evaluate whether it fits your real-time latency requirements.
